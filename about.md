I come from the land of spicy charmers and snake curries. Oh wait, I got that mixed up, I meant spicy snakes and charming curries.

> Fun fact: I named one of the drinks in the Boston Public Library's Newsfeed cafe. It is a Sherlock inspired "Moriar-Tea".

When I'm not hanging out at the library naming drinks, I like looking at the sky, collecting t-shirts, and petting every dog that comes my way.  
I also like telling stories, with words (written and spoken), pictures (moving and still),
and hand puppets.
