I come from the land of spicy charmers and snake curries. Oh wait, I got that mixed up, I meant spicy snakes and charming curries.

> Fun fact: I named one of the drinks in the Boston Public Library's Newsfeed cafe. It is a Sherlock inspired "Moriar-Tea".

When I'm not naming drinks or hanging out at the library, I like telling stories. Be it through words, pictures, or video.
