title: Me Talk Good English One Day
---
 
It's just another winter day in Boston. Bundled up penguins, with cups of Dunkin Donuts coffee, waddle down the streets, carefully avoiding the heaps of dirty slushy snow.
A. and I are walking up the stairs at the Prudential Center Mall. I'm already out of breath by the third step and wheezing like a whale out of water. I'm halfway through telling A. a story about my maternal grandfather. "So the thing is", I pant, "He's really good in English. But he learnt it a long time back, so..." before I can finish, I notice a slight smile flicker across A's face. 

The Nervous Immigrant in me freezes- terrified and embarrassed. The Person of Color Expat in me is not so shy and scared. I stare at him, waiting for a reason. "Good in English", he snorts, "is such an Indian thing to say". It's supposed to be funny and I laugh it off.
Nervous Immigrant and Confident Expat both sigh in relief. At least I didn't mispronounce anything and say something incredibly stupid. He isn't wrong. Good in English is a very Indian thing to say. Indians say it as a compliment. Speaking English fluently is something I should be proud of. It's a talent, like being able to add up double digit numbers without a calculator.
 
I grew up in a country with a massive colonial hangover (as in, the country had the hangover, not me).  Right from the time I was in pre-school, I was constantly reminded by my teachers that we were in an "English-medium school", it was supposed to be a privilege. We had to behave better than the students from the Hindi or Bengali medium schools. Because they were savages- uncivilized and uncouth. And we were supposed to be the exact opposite.

All because we were being taught in our colonizer's tongue instead of our mother tongue.
 
An English medium school never struck me as a privilege because I was born into an English speaking family. My grandmother spoke better English than most of my school teachers. My parents both worked in the media world, so I was constantly surrounded with films, books, music, magazines and newspapers. All in English.  It was the only language I was completely comfortable in. I could speak in my mother tongue, but English words would always creep into the conversation, like tiny, harmless insects.

English was the language I thought in, dreamt up stories in, sang in, made puns in.
So I was slightly disappointed when my family started giving my sister and me a hard time for not speaking enough Bengali. As if we developed our language skills in a vacuum bubble.  They complained about us being too anglicized, too "tyaansh" (a Bengali word for someone who goes to great lengths to disassociate themselves with anything Indian, and clumsily tries to embrace Western culture. Emphasis on the word 'clumsily')

Slightly ironic that they scolded us about using too much English, in English. But I think by then I had realized that parents were strange people who went beyond double standards, so I let them be.

I never really thought about languages till I moved to America. I've passionately held on to my Indian accent, not out of patriotic love for the motherland, but just to prove a point.
I know my English, like the rest of me, is painfully Indian. But somehow the Indian accent just isn't as "cute" as any other European accent.  When you think of an Indian accent, your mind doesn't conjure up cuteness. It conjures up hairy, middle aged browness at the 7-11.

One time, I remember I ordered a sandwich with Italian herbs and cheese. I pronounced the 'h' in 'herbs' as Indians do and noticed the server just glance at me for a bit longer than necessary. The Immigrant in me cringed. It was too late to correct myself. Now I drop the 'h' even when I'm talking to my mother ("Of course marijuana is a medicinal 'erb... just look it up"). My friend, A., pronounces the 'h' in herbs too (British people and Indians share pronunciations. What a surprise). But he feels no awkwardness when he says it. When he says it to a server, they nod and there are no uncomfortable stares. A part of me wants to believe it's just based on confidence. Mispronounce words with confidence and unless it's something major, they'll let you be. But a bigger part of me believes its somehow connected to the fact that he's not brown.
 
The Indian accent can be exotic and jarring, cute and crude. When I talk to Americans, I make it a point not to fall into the rabbit hole of dropped R's and A's that don't sound like A's. 
I want to be fluent in a language without having to adopt the accent. And along the way I have to accept the polite "You speak very well for an Indian" compliments. Because with skin that's not white, and an accent that's not American, my English should be broken. And my body shouldn't be the only heavy thing about me, my accent should be too.
But in a weird way, I'd like to believe that keeping my accent when I talk to Americans is a sign of respect. It's my way of saying I don't think you're stupid enough to not understand basic English. I'm sure you're smarter than the world gives you credit for, and you can understand me, even if I sound different.
"Sound different" is a polite way of putting it. I straight up massacre words- butchering their pronunciations and messing up syntax with a vengeance. The Nervous Immigrant in me can pick up the signs by now. When I notice the slight smiles, or the slight confusion clouding their eyes, I know I've messed up. And then the stream of excuses, nervous laughter and apologies begin: I picked up that word by reading it, British English is different from American English, English isn't my first language, and so on. All this is the Nervous Immigrant. The Person of Color Expat in me just wants to say _oh fuck off I speak three languages, I'm bound to mess up a bit. How many languages do YOU speak?_
 
The Nervous Immigrant and Person of Color Expat live together in an uneasy state of peace. While the Immigrant worries about losing touch with her mother tongue, the Expat wants to compensate by holding onto the Indian accent. While the Immigrant wants to blend in and rhyme 'can't' with 'ant', the Expat wants to give every person who compliments her English a mini-lecture on the history of colonialism in India. And both of them never want to make the mistake of saying "Good in English" in front of a white person ever again.
